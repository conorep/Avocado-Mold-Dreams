# Avocado-Mold-Dreams
The Avocado Mold web store
created by Conor O'Brien, Pat Tagliavia, and Regina Vanata

## A BRIEF WALKTHROUGH AND DESCRIPTION:
Welcome to our web store! Upon entering, you will find a database-generated list of all items for sale. Click an item to add it to your shopping cart.

The my account page allows you to create a new customer account or login to your active customer portal. It will route appropriately based on whether or not a customer account is an admin (customer to customer portal, admin to admin portal). Passwords are hashed and stored in the database.

If you log into an active customer account, you will be able to verify or alter your personal contact info and shipping information. You will also be able to review your order history and whether or not the items have shipped, below which you can see all submitted questions and their respective answers.

If you log into an active admin account, you will be able to perform a wide variety of functions, including answer customer questions, add new products to the database/server, archive or delete items, fulfill orders, alter user accounts from admin to non-admin and back, or review tables filled with inventory listings, customer questions and the respective data, a full history of orders, and a full table of users + user info.

You can send questions to the site admin from any page (send your fellow admins a message as well if you'd like).
